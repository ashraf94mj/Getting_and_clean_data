Due to the size of the raw files too big, was not able to upload in github.
So must download and unzip the raw files into your main directory.
Then unzip file will be in its own folder called "UCI HAR Dataset"

Then run the run_analysis.R file in the main directory 

The output would be 2 files. The first will be "merged_tidy_dataset.txt" which contains all the raw data
The 2nd file would be the average of each variable for each activity and each subject obtain from the 1st file
